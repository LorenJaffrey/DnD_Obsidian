# `=this.file.name`
Northwest of Neverwinter, just off the Sword Coast, is another floating earthmote referred to as “Pirates’ Skyhold”. Soon after the Spellplague, some pirates in the area notedthe earthmote could serve as a defensible base in the coaststhey roamed. One band of pirates, in possession of a skyship,claimed the earthmote as their own and built up modestwooden fortifications on the earthmote.
A mysterious tragedy befell the skyhold that left most, if not all, of its pirate residents dead or missing. Their skyship remains docked on the earthmote as an eerie reminder of its abandonment. No one knows precisely what happened onthe skyhold, but scores of rumors about the location circulate in Neverwinter. Some claim a dragon took the skyhold, others claim it is being inhabited by Netherese, while still others claim it is haunted by all manner of ghosts.
It is also rumored that a hoard of treasure still exists on the earthmote. The pirates were reported to store their booty inthe skyhold, and given their sudden demise, it is thought thetreasure must surely still be on the earthmote somewhere.Getting to the skyhold, however, is no easy feat. Some formof aerial or magical transportation will need to be procuredto access the area.

## Dungeon Masters’ Inspiration

### An Open Book
Per the Neverwinter Campaign Setting of Fourth Edition, the Pirate’s Skyhold was intentionally left mysterious and open for Dungeon Masters to create their own adventures at the location.

### Dragon’s Hoard
It’s well-known dragons love a good hoard! A younger dragon may have attacked the Skyhold, slain all the inhabitants, and kept the pirates’ booty as its very own hoard.

### Zombie Pirates
The god of death, Myrkul, has been very active in the area (see Dragon of Icespire Peak and the Beyond Dragon of Icespire Peak trilogy).
Undead have overrun the Skyhold and turned it into a fort of the damned. The Death Knight-Dreadnaught is eerily anchored below the earthmote.

### I’ll Take One of Each
Myrkul has sent a Dracolich or Ghost Dragon to the Skyhold, where it sits on a hoard of pirate booty and lords over an army of undead pirates!
