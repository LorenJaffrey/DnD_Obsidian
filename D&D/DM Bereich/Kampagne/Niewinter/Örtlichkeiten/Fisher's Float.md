Fisher’s Float is an earthmote just southwest of Neverwinter that a hearty guild of fishermen has made their home and business headquarters. The homes and warehouses visible on the earthmote are austere by all accounts. The small,wooden shanties certainly imply that the fishers and sailors that call the Float their home are not living indulgent lifestyles.
While these fishermen peacefully supply a massive portion of Neverwinter’s seafood, they also manage to keep largely to themselves. As a result, there exist plenty of rumors about the goings-on of Fisher’s Float. One particularly prevalent rumor is that the residents of Fisher’s Float are in some form of allegiance with evil sea gods and/or sea monsters.
