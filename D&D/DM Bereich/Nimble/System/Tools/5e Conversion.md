### Adventures
You can run any 5e compatible adventure right out of the book with no additional prep and minimal changes. For the skills, saves, and conditions that were combined or changed, just use the updated name.
### Saving Throws
CON save -> STR save
WIS/CHA save -> WIL save
### Skill Checks
Animal Handling/Nature/Survival -> Naturecraft
Athletics -> Might
Deception/Persuasion/Performance -> Influence
History/Religion -> Lore
Investigation/Medicine -> Examination
Sleight of Hand/Acrobatics -> Finesse
### Conditions
Paralyzed, Stunned, Unconscious -> Incapacitated
### Monsters
You can likewise use any 5e compatible monster stat block with Nimble with minimal tweaks on the fly. Run them exactly as written, using their move, action, bonus action, etc. as normal; simply change their AC to armor and roll their damage dice for attacks.

* **Monster Attacks.** They miss, hit, and crit just like heroes.
* **Monster Armor.** 5e monsters that have **14–17 AC have Medium Armor**, less than that is unarmored, more than that is Heavy.

> [!tip]- A Note on Armor
> Encounter balance in Nimble is much more forgiving than other games. A GM can adjust armor up or down quite freely without breaking encounter balance. If too many monsters have the same AC, the GM can upgrade/downgrade their armor for variety. Unarmored should be the bulk of monsters your party encounters (~60%), Medium should be uncommon (only about 30% of the monsters in any given session), while Heavy should be quite rare (~10%).
### 5e Legendary Monsters
Nimble Legendary monsters will be much easier to run and provide a more dynamic experience, but you can run 5e legendary monsters as written just like other monsters! Change their AC to armor and simply roll their damage dice for attacks. They act 1/round (using their Lair / Legendary Actions as normal in 5e).
### Optional Tweaks
* **Monster Saves.** To simplify play, roll a d20 for saves without bonuses. If a monster is notably Strong/Frail, Fast/Slow, or Smart/Dumb, give them advantage or disadvantage on their STR, DEX, or WIL/INT saves. Legendary monsters may have advantage on multiple or all saves.
* **Player Agency.** When a monster would take away agency in some way from heroes (incapacitate, paralyze, petrify, or stun), consider the new Dazed condition instead (–1 action for 1 round).
### 5e Spells
Most 5e spells should be easy enough to use with Nimble without any change. Though it’s not recommended to use 5e combat-related spells, some of the more unique utility spells could make the game more interesting. Use common sense, but here are some rules of thumb:

* The spell’s level is how much mana it costs. Range is shorter in Nimble (typically 16 spaces/80 ft. max)
* Cantrips, Bonus Action, Reaction, or other simple, non-damaging spells cost **1 Action**; other leveled spells cost **2 Actions**, large AoE spells that can be cast from a distance cost **3 Actions**.
### 5e Magical Items
For items that change stats, simply use the ability score modifier.
### 5e Races & Classes
* **Race & Background:** Pick a Nimble ancestry and background and flavor them however you like.
* **Classes:** For the smoothest experience, it is recommended to use a Nimble class; however, you can use any 5e-compatible class. Simply swap in the Nimble attack and armor rules. Don’t attempt to mix and match 5e and Nimble spells, feats, or other options; stick with one or the other. See the Nimble 5e booklet for more.
### Monster Skill Checks
If a contested skill check is ever desired or necessary, since Nimble monsters don’t have skills or stats, you can roll an additional die based on the creature’s capabilities and add it to the skill check instead:

* **No bonus or +1d4.** This monster is untrained or average at this skill.
* **+1d6–1d10.** This monster is trained or very good in the skill.
* **+1d12–1d20.** This monster is world class or has legendary capability with this skill.
