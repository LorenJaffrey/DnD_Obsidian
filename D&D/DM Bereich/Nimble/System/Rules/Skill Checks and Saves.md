When you want to affect the world (convince an NPC, spot a trap, pick a lock, etc.), the GM may call for a skill check. Roll 1d20 and add your skill (the max bonus a skill can ever have is +12). If the total meets or exceeds the Difficulty Challenge (DC), you succeed; otherwise, you fail. A roll of 1 always fails regardless of any other bonuses, while a roll of 20 always succeeds. The DC varies based on the task:

* Easy: Spotting a large Ogre crouched behind a small bush might be a DC 8 Perception check.
* Medium: A hidden doorway behind a bookcase might be a DC 12 Examination check.
* Challenging: Calming an injured Owlbear stuck in a trap may be a DC 15 Naturecraft check.
* Very Difficult: Intuiting the true intentions of a trained Spy may be a DC 18 Insight check.
* Extremely Difficult: Disarming an ancient legendary trap may be a DC 20+ Finesse check.
### Saves
When the world affects you, roll a save instead of a skill check. Roll 1d20 and add the relevant stat. A roll of 1 always fails, 20 always saves. You can choose to fail any save instead of rolling.
• STR Save. When your overall fitness and physicality is tested. STR helps resist forced movement, restraint, poison, and extreme temperatures.
• DEX Save. When your agility or speed is tested. DEX helps you dive for cover in an explosion or
stay on your feet while running across icy terrain.
• INT Save. When your intelligence is tested. INT helps you see though tricks and illusions.
• WIL Save. When your courage or personality is tested. WIL helps you resist charm or fear effects.
### Heroes and Saves
• Unless otherwise noted, the DC for effects a hero causes is 10+KEY.
• When making saves, each hero has 1 advantaged save (+), 1 disadvantaged save (–), and
2 neutral saves.
