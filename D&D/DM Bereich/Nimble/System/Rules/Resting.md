# Field Rests
While out adventuring, heroes can take Field Rests to regain HP. 

**Catch Breath.**
Requires at least 10 minutes to tend to your injuries. Expend any number of Hit Dice one at a time (roll them and add your STR to each), and regain that many HP.

**Make Camp.**
If you rest for at least 8 hours with food and sleep, take the maximum value for each Hit Die you expend instead of rolling. Add your STR to each Hit Die as usual.

> [!faq]- What if I Have Negative STR?
> Your frail body doesn’t recover as quickly as others. Subtract your STR from each HD you expend.
# Safe Rests
Safe Rests take place in a safe location designated by your GM, typically lodging at an inn overnight—but could also be at a secret oasis, a well-stocked cabin in the woods, near a sacred shrine, or the like. Camping in the open wilderness or in a dungeon is **not** sufficient for gaining the benefits of a Safe Rest.

After a Safe Rest, heroes recover all of their HP, Hit Dice, mana (and other class-specific resources), and heal 1 Wound. Safe Rests are a great opportunity for downtime activities as well.

> [!faq]- Rest for HOW Long?!
> If your table prefers to largely skip downtime activities and narrate past a week of resting, that’s okay too! For a more realistic convalescence time, 1 week per wound recovered may make more sense.
### Lodging
The cheapest rooms at an inn save you money but may lead to complications. On the other hand, some inns may allow you to pay a premium for a nicer room and amenities, giving you a Temporary Boon. Typical prices (each person/day): Poor (5 sp), Comfortable (2 gp), and Lavish (10 gp). Lavish inns allow players to gain one Temporary Boon the following day.
