### Gold & Currency
Gold is a versatile reward that gives heroes the freedom to choose their own rewards. While some gold will be spent on necessities like lodging, its primary appeal is to purchase exciting upgrades: better weapons, armor, potions, wands, or magical items.

Currency is made up of Silver (sp) and Gold pieces (gp). 10 silver = 1 gold. 1 sp is roughly the cost of a humble meal; 1 gp, a sumptuous feast. Most small towns will have equipment and items worth 50 gp or less. You’ll need to adventure to larger towns or cities or find a traveling merchant to purchase more valuable pieces of equipment.
### How Much Gold?
This table outlines the average amount of gold each hero will typically gain per level. A quest for a noble cause or from a poor villager might pay modestly (one or two levels below average), while one from a wealthy noble with questionable motives may offer a more extravagant reward (one or two levels above average).

### On Buying Magical Items
Most adventurers can save up enough to purchase uncommon or rare magical items, often found in specialty shops in large cities. However, very rare or legendary items are typically far too expensive to buy and must be earned through adventuring.
### Too Much Gold?
An overabundance of gold has its challenges and it may attract unwanted attention:
* **It’s Cumbersome.** You can only carry so much gold before your pockets and bags are full. Large amounts must be transported via caravan or ship and safely stored somewhere while adventuring.
* **Bandits & Thieves.** Pickpockets, ambushers, and even organized crime may want a cut.
* **Jealousy.** Rival adventurers, "old money" nobles, resentful poor, debt collectors, etc.
* **Corruption.** Government looking for bribes, fake "opportunities," suspicious authorities.
* **Curses.** A cache of gold or jewels cursed by dark magic, greedy spirits, or treasure guardians.
* **Fame.** Opportunists, sycophants, bounty hunters, or warlords all may want a cut.
* **People In Need.** A destitute village, public works projects, beggars, allies in need.
* **Greedy Monsters.** Dragons and other powerful beings are drawn to large hoards of gold.
