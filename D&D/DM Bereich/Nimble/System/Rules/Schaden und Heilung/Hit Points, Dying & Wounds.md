**Death**
You die when you have taken 6 Wounds (unless you have an ability that changes this number). 
There are ways to revive a hero who has died, but they are rare and often come at a very steep cost.

> [!Warning]- Gritty Dying Rules
> Optional rules for a more challenging or “old school” style of game: You can reduce the max number of Wounds heroes have. 
> Anywhere from a max of 5 Wounds for slightly harder, all the way down to 1–2 Wounds for a very lethal game! 
> 
> You can also have each Wound impose a cumulative –1 penalty to rolls: skill checks, saves, or even ALL rolls! (If you’re a real glutton for punishment.)
