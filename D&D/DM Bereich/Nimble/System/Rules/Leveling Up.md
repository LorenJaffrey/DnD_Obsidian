The GM may allow you to gain a level (LVL) whenever you complete an appropriately challenging quest or adventure. At level 1, this may be as simple as clearing some angry rats out of a basement or rescuing someone from the woods. Each subsequent level will generally take more effort (and therefore more time). When a hero gains a level:
* **HP Increase.** Roll your Hit Die with advantage and increase your max HP by that much.
* **More Endurance.** Your Hit Die max increases by 1 (it is typically equal to your level).
* **More Skilled.** Gain 1 skill point. Additionally, you may move 1 point from one skill to another (as long as the skill doesn’t become negative), reflecting your hero’s evolving expertise and priorities.
* **Class Features.** Gain new class features for your level. This may mean increasing your mana pool, new spells, or even selecting a subclass!
* **Other Adjustments.** If any of your base stats increase, remember to adjust other elements of your character sheet as needed (skills, damage, Initiative, armor, mana, languages, etc.).

> The maximum bonus a skill can have is +12.
