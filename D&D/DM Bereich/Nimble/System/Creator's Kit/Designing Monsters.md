Monsters should not simply be differently shaped bags of Hit Points. Each different kind monster (even with identical stats) should FEEL different to fight (their tactics, how they deal damage, how they avoid it, etc.). Monster groups (e.g., Kobolds, Goblins, Bandits) should have a share ability that all monsters of that type have. It should be simple but give a big sense of flavor for that monster. Goblins laugh at you when you miss, kobolds get stabby when you kill their friends, bandits are crafty and particularly don’t want to die! Each of these will make players engage with them differently and use different tactics.

In order for a heroic party to be able to have variety in their encounters with a monster group (and to be able to encounter them at varying levels), each monster group should have a fairly wide band of monster levels, for example:

* **Kobolds:** LVL 1/3 to LVL 1
* **Goblins:** LVL 1/3 to LVL 2
* **Bandits:** LVL 1/3 to LVL 4
* **Snakemen:** LVL 1 to LVL 8

Don't feel the need to cover every level, especially if a monster's nature doesn't allow them to reasonably scale up or down to very high or low levels. Giants, for instance, their lowest level may be in 12 the double digits, and that's okay.
### Monster Roles
Monster groups should also have creatures that can fulfill a variety of roles: Melee, Ranged, Controller, AoE, Summoner, Striker, Ambusher, etc. A GM need not even be aware of these, the design of each monster should make the optimal play pattern obvious. Some creatures can fill multiple roles for flexibility (e.g., goblins are equally good at range and in melee).

* **Melee.** Most effective when toe-to-toe.
* **Ranged.** Most effective at Range.
* **Controller.** Hampers the heroes, low damage.
* **Support.** Primarily boosts the damage or abilities of their allies.
* **AoE.** Deals damage to multiple heroes at a time (cleaving strikes, shouts, auras, etc.)
* **Summoner.** Summons additional monsters to the battlefield (usually minions).
* **Striker.** High damage, low survivability.
* **Ambusher.** Not immediately visible when combat begins.
* **Defender.** High survivability, low damage.
### Don't Leave the GM Wondering What To Do
Give the GM a hand, make it as easy as possible to run the monster! Monster should always either have 1 action to perform, or 1 clear BEST action to perform. For instance a Troll can use either Claws or Bite. Bite deals far more damage, but it requires a creature to be Prone. Claws can knock Prone. The order of operations is immediately clear, use Claw until someone falls down, then Bite.

Note also that the Troll's 2 attacks use the same die size to make running it easier and smoother for the GM, and one attack's damage is clearly much better than the other (Claw: 1d4+10, Bite 1d4+20). If Claw instead was 6d4 and Bite was 1d4+20, it'd be much less obvious which is stronger.

Monsters that will commonly fight together will ideally all use the same dice (e.g. goblins all use d6s, kobolds all use d4s). This helps prevent the GM from needing to search for lots of different dice at the table. It’s a very little thing, but every way we can make the GM's job easier, and remove mental overhead for them, means they have more capacity for strategy, role playing, lobbing insults, jokes, and telling an interesting story.
### Monster Attack Effects
Causing effects other than damage is a great way to distinguish between different kinds of monsters, even when they have the same HP and their attacks deal the same amount of average damage. These are by no means exhaustive, but for starters:

* **Automatic.** Hit or miss, some effect happens. Think, a shockwave from a Giant's strike. Even if it misses or a hero Defends, you might still get pushed back or knocked Prone.
* **On Hit.** An effect even if all of the damage is reduced to 0. Grappled or restrained by a huge bug, snakeman, or plant creature.
* **On Damage.** What could uniquely happen when blood is drawn, even 1 single point of damage. Think poisoned blades from an assassin, a deathly touch from a wraith.
* **On Crit/Miss.** What could happen what an monster's attack succeeds wildly? They could knock Prone, Daze, they could even swallow the hero entirely. You could have some other powerful effect, even in place of rolling additional damage.
* **On Death.** Care must be taken HOW these creatures are taken down. Plant creatures full of acid, explosive fire elementals, etc. Their allies could get free movement or attacks.
### What To Avoid
**Avoid monsters that heal.** Subtracting and adding HP is fiddly. Monsters can be given armor, more HP, or other defensive abilities instead, giving the same flavor but with reduced mechanics.

**Avoid "kiting" monsters.** Monsters that constantly run away from heroes and permanently stay just out of range can be more frustrating than fun. Flying monsters are notorious for this kind of mechanic (flying also adds a 3rd dimension that can be hard to physically portray at the table). Monsters should at least spend some time in the "danger zone," getting close to heroes or landing in order to attack. Skirmishers and flying monsters are less frustrating at higher levels as heroes gain more tools to deal with it. For wall/ceiling-crawling monsters like spiders, ensure ways to knock them down (e.g., damage, critical hits, or destroying webs).

**Avoid complex individual monsters.** Each monster should be very simple to run with a crystal clear “this is what I will do on my turn” for the GM to execute. Monster ***groups*** as a whole should feel tactically unique and complex without any of the parts actually *being* complex. Consider how these different monsters will be mixed together (yes, an individual goblin or kobold isn’t particularly interesting to fight, but that will never happen— they only exist in a context of other kobolds and goblins.

**Avoid being too detailed or too brief.** Each statblock should contain enough information to run it easily, but not so much that the important bits get lots in a sea of text.
