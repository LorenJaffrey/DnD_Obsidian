Play proceeds most quickly when each player can take their turn without interruption and without waiting on anyone else. This is Flow. Actions that interrupt the Flow should ideally be both **important** and **rare**. Failing that, they should at least happen **asynchronously**.

**Important & Rare.** A great example of this is Interposing for a Dying ally. This is both very important, and likely happens only on occasion.

**Asynchronous.** Defend does technically interrupt the Flow, AND can happen rather commonly (each turn), AND is relatively low impact—the saving grace is that this happens asynchronously, or off turn. A hero choosing to Defend can privately calculate their HP without slowing anyone else down. The GM doesn't care (or even need to know) when a Hero Defends. That’s between them and their character sheet.

Any fiddliness, especially if it disrupts the Flow, should happen off-turn whenever possible. See the Oathsworn’s Judgment Dice, and the Berserker's “That all you got?!” Those dice are rolled or expended when it’s not their turn. No one else needs to wait for those actions to resolve.
### The Worst Offender
The worst offender for breaking the Flow is **any mechanic that requires information from another player before proceeding** (e.g., in older d20 fantasy games: rolling to hit vs AC, rolling initiative, or saving throws). These are common (they happen for EVERY attack), are often low impact (it would not be game breaking if they just *happened*), and they completely halt play for everyone until the multiple steps and back-and-forth is resolved. Avoid these mechanics like the plague if you want the game to run smoothly.

This is why saves should be quite rare and meaningful. If a save MUST take place, consider if you can have it not tied to damage but an additional secondary effect. This way, if 3 of the 4 targets die first, you only need to roll 1 save instead of 4. Saves should be… *saved* for very meaningful (e.g., ones that can apply powerful conditions) or uncommonly used abilities (e.g., 1/encounter).

Cantrips and low level spells should NOT require a save or any other feedback from other players. Take a look at how these spells changed over the course of playtesting:

**Old Version**
> **Entice**
> *Cantrip, 1 Action, Single Target*
> WIL Save. The target takes 1d6 damage and moves 2 spaces closer to you. Repeat until they save.

Note that this initial version potentially required numerous save rolls AND damage rolls; combine that with this being a low impact cantrip, it could conceivably be cast 3 or more times EVERY ROUND. It took far too long to resolve this single spell. So it was simplified to resolve very quickly and a small bonus was added to compensate.

**Final Version**
> **Entice**
> *Cantrip, 1 Action, Single Target*
> **Damage:** 1d4 (ignoring armor). On hit: target moves 2 spaces closer to you.

The final version uses a single roll to both determine damage and movement. Instead of a save, a d4 was used as the damage die to put a reasonable limit on how often this can take place (the d4 is most likely to miss when cast multiple times). Similarly, let's take a look at the initial version of Vicious Mockery:

**Old Version**
> **Vicious Mockery**
> *Cantrip, 1 Action*
> WIL Save. 1d6 psychic damage. The taget's next attack is made with disadvantage. +1d6 damage every 5th level.

Note that this initial version breaks many of the guidelines. It is a low impact cantrip that requires a save. Lacks clarity (if I land this twice, are their next 2 attacks with Disadvantage, or their next single attack made with Disadvantage 2?), and the spell adds dice as one levels up (up to a maximum of 5d6 at level 20). Too fiddly, too slow. Here's the updated final version:

**Final Version**
> **Vicious Mockery**
> *Cantrip, 1 Action*
> **Damage:** 1d4+INT psychic (ignoring armor). On hit: the target is Taunted during their next turn. +2 damage every 5 levels.

The final version of the spell does essentially the same thing (a small amount of damage and a debuff), but does it in a more streamlined, clear, fun, and intuitive way.

Special attention must go toward ensuring that each action is simple and quick to resolve. Each step doesn’t take long, but when multiplied across every attack of every round, it adds up to slog. People start checking their phones, losing interest, and you can’t do as much cool stuff.

Flow should be maximized and interruptions minimized. If there is an interruption it should be minimal (in terms of how long it takes to resolve), big (in terms of the result it has on the game state), heroic (or conniving—for the bad guys), and rare.
### The Source of Fun
The fun comes from how all of these simple pieces interact with each other and how the heroes and monsters shape the story. Complex rules elements that time a long time to physically perform don't add to the fun, they detract from it.
