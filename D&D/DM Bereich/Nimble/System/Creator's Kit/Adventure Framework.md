Emphasize tight writing, no extra stuff. Full sentences are neither necessary nor recommended. Prioritize brevity so the text can quickly be scanned at a glance and repeated in the GM’s own words rather than read like a script.
### Components of a Tight Adventure
**Total Adventure Length.** (1200–2000 words)

* **Cool, Evocative Name.** Should get the GM excited to run it, and the Heroes excited to play it.
* **What Really Happened/Adventure Background.** This is for the GM to read beforehand. It should contain secrets the heroes can discover as they play. Think of adventures as a mystery that is solved as the heroes delve further into it. What is the mystery/problem? How is it solved as we play? (100 words).
* **2–3 Adventure Hooks.** Different factions who ask, different rewards promised. This makes it easier to slot into widely varying campaigns (100 words).
* **2-4 treasures.** Not all will be given/found. Not necessarily powerful magical items. Interesting things to be used creatively. Some simple, maybe 1 powerful one (100 words).
### Exploration Events
**2–4 traveling events** (200-300 words) Complications/interesting things that happen along the way the players can respond to: foreshadowing a monster, getting lost, overcoming an obstacle, learn some backstory, motivate the heroes (these bad guys are really BAD because…), etc. These “set the stage” for the adventuring environment, how is this place different from other places? For example:

* **In a desert.** How can we make the heroes feel/struggle with the heat? Can we do anything with mirages? Lack of water? Sandstorms? Anything else to make it FEEL like the desert?
* **In a forest.** Do they get lost in the dense undergrowth? Are they hunted by beasts? Are they caught in goblin traps? Are they tricked by a faerie? Can they ask the forest animals for aid?
* **In the sewers.** How bad does it smell, what effect does that have? Anything else unique about these particular sewers? Do the rats talk? Does the water contain magical runoff?
### Dungeon Locations
**6-10 “rooms”** (Doesn't have to be a literal dungeon. It could be a grove, palace, ruins, ravine, cave, sewers, hideout, airship, etc). This is the meat of the adventure (600-1200 words, 50-100 words per room). Each room must have a name and:

* **Description.** A few words of descriptive text (max 1 sentence). The idea is that the GM can quickly scan this description and use it as the prompt for the heroes to begin interacting with the area, asking questions, etc. What do they *immediately* see, hear, etc. Give enough information for the heroes to start playing with, but no more.
* **Additional Bullets.** 2-4 additional things to interact with, accomplish, learn, etc. These contain the answers to questions players will ask, the challenge present, the bits of interest. What can they DO here?
### Room Contents
* **A trap/obstacle/problem.** The point of these rooms is to allow space for CREATIVITY and secondarily to expend resources. Traps/obstacles should almost always be obvious. Failing to successfully navigate it can result in damage, Wounds, conditions, alert others, make an enemy, loss of treasure (ONLY as of yet unobtained treasure—be VERY cautious with taking away treasure the heroes have already earned). These rooms can be designed with no particular solution, let the heroes come up with a solution.
* **Information.** Foreshadowing/information about the theme or direction of the adventure. These rooms can raise questions or provide answers to already existing questions.

> [!tip]- Avoid Info Dumps
> Unloading of a large amount of exposition all at once, often automatically and without the request of the heroes. MAKE SURE the heroes initiate any information you give them, and spread the information throughout a dungeon.

* **A Combat Encounter.** Each encounter should be scaled per hero so the GM doesn’t need to adjust any numbers. What are the baddies doing when the heroes come? (NOT simply standing around). Combat can be the obvious answer, but not necessarily the *only* answer.
* **NPCs.** To fight (see above), to rescue, negotiate with, buy from, ally with, bamboozle, from another region/quest, to kidnap & ransom, etc.
* **Dilemmas.** If you take this path, you can’t take the other path. If you ally with this faction, you cannot ally with the other, etc.
* **WEIRD things.** Crystals that produce “anti-light”, Mind controlling fungus, Walls made of hands, Paintings with eyes that follow, room with no sound, feel smells, reversed gravity…
### Agency
Each dungeon should maximize player agency. Rather than being strictly linear, there should be some opportunity to meaningfully choose "this way or that way." Multiple ways to solve traps and puzzles, optional rooms, multiple entrances, secret passages, etc.
### Ending
The end of a dungeon should have a satisfying climax, typically this means it culminates in a boss battle of some sort (not always, but usually). Any cool loot the boss has, expect the heroes to want to take. Adventures could end with negotiation, a plot twist, a revelation that “this thing goes way deep than any of us thought”, a cliffhanger.
### Aftermath
What happens (good or bad) after they return to town?
### Maps
Ideally an adventure will include a map or simple flowchart of rooms. Make it simple enough that the layout can be drawn on the spot on a dry erase mat. Many players have trouble visualizing things in their minds, help them out!
### Extra Notes
Think of any notes you'd create as you were reading through the adventure to prep for running it (e.g., simple role-playing ideas, monster statblocks, special rules reminders). If it's helpful for you, consider adding that to the adventure or clarifying whatever needed it. Do as much of the prep for the GM as possible!
