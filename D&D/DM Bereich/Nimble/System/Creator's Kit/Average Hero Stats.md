**Armor**
This takes into account equipment and other defensive abilities (e.g., Ice Shield).

**Effective HP**
The base combat math assumes Heroes, on average, spend 1 action defensively per turn. This number includes the hero's Armor × the average number of rounds in an encounter (see below).

**Damage/Turn**
This assumes 2 actions per turn spent offensively. Some classes will output less damage (but they can aid combat in other useful ways), others could output more if the situation is ideal (AoE abilities, assistance & setup from allies). This need not be a target per se, but if your numbers are very far off you should have a good reason for it.

**Average Combat Length**
Typical encounter math assumes 3–4 rounds of combat (or, for Legendary encounters, 15 hero turns). If an encounter lasts much longer than that it may start to feel like a slog; much shorter, and players may not have time to see the payoff to their setup and be disappointed.

Again, these are not hard rules! Some of the most fun is when we deviate from the average, just make sure you're doing it on purpose and for a good reason.
