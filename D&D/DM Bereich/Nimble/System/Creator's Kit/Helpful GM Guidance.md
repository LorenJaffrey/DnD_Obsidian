Help the GM as much as possible! Any lore, tactics, or twists they don't like they can ignore or change. It's better to supply usable ideas rather than make the GM come up with it themselves. Include some basic background information for the GM to work with. This helps distinguish this monster group from other monsters with similar stats.

**Lore**
Interesting and practical information that How do these monster interact with one another? What is their society like? Who is in charge? What do they want? Some ideas to make GMs and heroes say "oo, that's cool!" Give specific info on each monster too!

**Loot**
Thematic items for when heroes say "I loot the corpse." They need not be magical items, but feel free to include RP items and quest related items!

**Premade Encounters**
Themed, pre-made groups of monsters grouped by party level. Brief information on how they interact with one another and the heroes on the battlefield. Each one should feel mechanically and thematically different.

**Increasing the Difficulty**
Optimal tactics deisgned to make the GM feel like a mastermind! Explain the subtleties of any interactions of your monster statblocks.

**Decreasing the Difficulty**
How to run the monsters in a subtly sub-optimal way to ease up on the heroes when the GM has over-tuned an encounter or for when the heroes are particularly unlucky or playing poorly. 

**Names**
If there is a chance the monster group will engage in role-playing include names!

**What to Say in Combat**
For monsters that can talk in combat, give the GM some idea seeds to work with to push combat in a desired direction:
* Hint at a weakness. Damage vulnerability, RP, lore weaknesses, etc.
* Boast about a strength. Reveal how abilities work, resistances, etc.
* Make the heroes hate you more. Taunt and goad heroes! "Yes, we killed your pathetic friend, he begged for mercy!"
* Make the heroes more willing to parley. "You are an honorable foe, I submit."
* Hint at lore. "The High Flamecaller will avenge!"
* Tip hand at tactics (make combat easier). "Surround the little one and strike!"
* Mislead (to make combat harder). "Horde, strike that one!" (but really attack another hero)
* Egg them on. "Haha, you are so easily fooled!"

**Defeat/Parley**
Alternative options for the GM rather than a TPK or what could the mon-ters do if they are losing?
