**Front-load the fun (but don't overwhelm).** It’s not very fun to have to wait until level 14+ to see a hero's build fully come online. Try hard to “front load” the really cool things by levels 3–7 (without making the very early levels overly complicated or busy). A class should feel quite complete by then, with additional levels simply giving more options and power, but the class fantasy should already be essentially fully unlocked.

**Level 1**
Should give a small taste of the unique mechanics of the class. Think simple and flavorful. Level 1 should NOT include any additional choices. There are enough choices being made at level 1 already: class, ancestry, stats, background, etc. no need to slow things down further.

**Level 2**
You can introduce 1 or 2 pieces of additional mechanical complexity (e.g., mana, more options to use their resource), just not too much.

**Level 3**
Subclass choice. Each subclass should push the class in one particular direction: more offensive, more defensive, better at range, better at buffing allies, better at hindering enemies, etc.

> [!tip]- Utility!
> Around levels 2-4 a class will typically get some fun out of combat utility ability as well.

**Level 4**
By now you are nearly a fully fledged hero. Typically introduces a big choice from among a list of class options (e.g. Savage Arsenal or Underhanded Abilities). Classes with a lot going on already may have their options at later levels. Simpler classes may have class options more frequently. Aim to have enough options so that by level 20 a hero would have chosen roughly 1/2 to 2/3 of them.

**Level 5 & 10**
Typically a big damage increase or other large jump in power level.

**Levels 7, 11, & 15**
Additional subclass boons. Do something you can already do, but better/more often. Gain a new iconic ability. Fill in a weakness. Overcome a common constraint other classes have.

**Levels 4, 8, 12, & 16**
Key Stat Increase. And a optionally another small boost (e.g., unlock an additional tier of spells).

**Levels 5, 9, 13, & 17**
Secondary Stat increase and a larger boost.

**Levels 18, 19, & 20**
Big feature (LVL 18), Epic Boon (LVL 19), Capstone (LVL 20). Very few people will ever reach levels 10-12, even fewer will reach beyond these levels—but don’t let this stop you from really putting in the work to make sure the higher levels remain interesting! Level 20 in particular should be a BIG DREAM type of ability. Something players can think about, theorycraft with, and imagine being awesome using it. It should serve as a motivation to play the class, even if they never reach level 20, it’s fun to dream of “how awesome it would be if…”

> [!tip]- Note
> These framework features are only a starting point. If a class has other core abilities (e.g., spellcasting, sneak attack) the cadence may vary slightly. Full spellcasters gain a new spell tier every other level. Half casters may gain new spells slightly slower.

### Resting
There are NO abilities that recharge on Field Rests. Field Rests should be identical for every class, they are only to regain lost gain HP. Otherwise the party can be divided, some wanting to continue adventuring, others wanting to rest after every encounter. See the 5e Warlock and Monk as somewhat infamous examples of this dynamic.

Players will often adopt "optimal" but unfun play patterns if allowed. Don't create mechanics that incentivize playing unheroically or annoyingly. GMs can disallow frequent rests at their own table by forcing "random encounters" upon the party, but that just further slows the story down and is a band-aid. Or they can homebrew a rule, but then risk becoming "the bad guy" not letting their players play how they want. Best to have the rules as written be the bad guy.

Don't incentivize sitting around and doing nothing. The optimal thing should also be the most fun, most heroic thing.
### Hoarding & Going Nova
Intelligently saving and using resources can be very fun, but their extremes: hoarding (NEVER spending resources) and going nova (immediately spending ALL of your resources) are both generally unfun play patterns. Since it can trivialize challenging encounters, or characters can feel underpowered or bored if they have spent all of their resources and have no way to regain it (or are afraid to spend them). Also frequently players will guess incorrectly when to hoard (going back to town with plenty of mana remaining) and when to spend their resources (there is another big monster right around the corner).

Lean toward "per encounter" and similar abilities, and you can encourage the wise spending of resources by allowing heroes to regain a small amount of spent resources temporarily.
### Lane Protection
Be careful not to step on the toes of other classes, maintain the unique mechanics and flavor of each class. No two classes should deal damage the same way, avoid damage the same way, move around the same way, etc. They should all fill a unique role and feel different to play. No class other than the Mage should have access to 3 spell schools and deal damage primarily through spending mana casting spells. No other class should get their damage increased when they are attacked or be able to freely Interpose—that is the domain of the Oathsworn.
### Retraining
In Nimble, heroes can retrain chosen abilities during a Safe Rest, think of a fun/thematic task the hero can perform to engage with the world and role play the means by which they choose new skills. Think of ways to get heroes to look for new NPCs, new areas, and ask questions of the GM to retrain. This allows the GM to introduce important new allies, environs, or even new problems and quests (the local wizard/soldier who retrains the mage/commander can ask for a favor afterward).
### Multiclassing
Don’t worry about building or balancing classes & subclasses with multi-classing in mind. That will exponentially complicate your work and also dilute the fun of the base class. It's okay for multiclassing to be overpowered, easy to break, and a bit silly. Let it happen, and leave it to local GMs to adjudicate or even to allow it or not.
### Clear & Concise Writing
Avoid overly wordy explanations designed to block "rules lawyers"—those who might exploit technicalities—since this can make the rules harder to read and less enjoyable for most players. Write in a way that’s clear and concise, instead of exhaustive detail that tries to cover every possible loophole. Trust the heroes and GM to interpret the rules sensibly, and don’t let the fear of rules lawyers bog down your writing with complexity. If you can also prevent rules exploitation without making the text longer or harder to read, that’s fine—but never sacrifice readability for it.

Take for example, the Birdfolk ancestry boon was initially worded: *"You have a fly speed as long as you are wearing Leather or lighter armor."* Compared to how it ended up in the final version: *"You have a fly Speed as long as you are wearing armor no heavier than Leather."* Both are brief and easy to read, but the second also prevents the GM from having to deal with unfun technicalities ("but I'm wearing Plate AND Leather armor so…").

For an example of a change that was overly wordy and technical, look at the rules for dual wielding. The rules do not go into deep detail about attacking with different sized weapons and multiple instances of disadvantage and other edge cases. A simple example is given, and the GM can adjudicate any edge cases with the rules given.

> [!tip]- Additional Clarity
> If such is needed, can be supplied in sidebars or FAQ! Simple rules followed by an example or FAQ in a callout box is often better than overly wordy core mechanics. Making it bite-sized helps with information transmission.

We should aim for brevity, even when clarity isn't an issue. For example, here is a comparison of how one feature was initially worded VS how it ended up in the final books:

**Old Version**
> **Key Attribute Increase.** You may increase one of your key attributes (STR or DEX ) by +1.

**Final Version**
> **Key Stat Increase.** +1 STR or DEX.

"Stat" is more clear (and shorter) than "Attribute," and we can cut an entire sentence, communicating the same idea in much fewer words. It may take a few rounds of revisions to hone your wording, but it’s worth it!
### Naming Classes
Use class names that do not have lots of built-in preconceptions. This will free you from explaining why your warlock or your sorcerer works this way instead of “how it’s supposed to work”.
### Stats, Skills & Equipment Proficiencies
Be VERY careful handing out shield and wand proficiency. They are VERY good. Likewise with plate and mail armor proficiency, but to a lesser extent.
