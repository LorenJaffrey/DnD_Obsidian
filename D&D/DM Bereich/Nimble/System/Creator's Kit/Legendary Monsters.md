If it's important for regular combat encounters to be easy to run (and it is), it's even ***moreso*** for legendary monsters. Having overly complex legendary monsters can be especially bad because these are often the climax of a multi-hour session or even potentially a year's long campaign. If the BBEG is a cakewalk (or an unintended TPK) because the GM missed some fine print in the statblock, that's going to sting even more deeply.

Legendary monsters must be easy to run at a glance. Avoid the temptation toward too many mechanics that interrupt *The Flow*, or those that are too fiddly.
### Tension of Battle
What makes for an interesting battle is **uncertainty**. If the bad guy is clearly winning and the heroes have no hope, it's not as much fun. Likewise if the heroes are clearly always winning and the bad guy has no hope, the excitement dampens. The most fun is where there are moments where it looks like the battle can go either way. At some portions of the fight, the heroes should be winning (typically early on in the fight), only for the bad guy to make a sudden comeback (Bloodied & Last Stand). How exciting!

The HP/Damage values on the legendary monster chart in the GMG allow for the heroes to have an edge in the first half of the fight, then for the bad guy's Bloodied effect to shift the tide of battle temporarily. The Last Stand should be a VERY dangerous situation to be in for more than just a few turns. This is when heroes can go all out to clinch a win!

> [!tip]- Change it Up!
> If you want to vary this cadence, you certainly can! You could make the boss extra difficult in the beginning, only for a severe weakness to show up when bloodied—just in time for the heroes to rally!
### The Math
The math behind legendary encounters assumes roughly **15 hero turns** to get to the Last Stand. So a party of 3 heroes is expected to each get roughly 5 turns, a party of 5 heroes are expected to get 3 turns each.

**Legendary Monster HP & Armor**
All other things being equal, it's recommended that a legendary monster have Medium armor. If it is unarmored, make sure you compensate for their survivability in some other way (see Dravok, All-Seeing Tyrant, in the GMG). An entire fight against a Heavily armored enemy can feel frustratingly slow. If they do have Heavy armor make sure you're careful to give some weaknesses that can be taken advantage of, or make it degrade as the fight goes on, or improve to Heavy from a lower armor level. The HP of a legendary monster with Medium Armor uses a multiplier of 80% compared to unarmored, heavy armor uses a multiplier of 60%. So an unarmored monster with 100 HP is roughly equivalent to one with medium armor and 80 HP, and 60 HP with heavy.

> [!tip]- Low Levels
> The legendary monster table in the GMG already accounts for lower levels since heroes tend to have fewer ways to deal with armor then.
### Give a Script!
Possibly more important than the stats and mechanics with legendary encounters, is the STORY. Don't forget that combat is a great place (possibly the best) to inject memorable story beats.

No need to write everything a legendary monster might say, but giving the GM a few lines to taunt the heroes is good fun. What do they say when they crit a hero? When they drop a hero to 0 HP? When they are bloodied or hit their last stand? Do they negotiate, do they taunt the heroes about releasing an even greater evil with their death? Do they alone have information the heroes desperately want? Egg the heroes on, make it memorable and special to fight legendary creatures. Here's an example from The Vanishing Caravans adventure in the GMG:

* **Opening Attack.** "You should have taken my offer. Now, I’m afraid I’ll have to make this hurt!"
* **On Crit.** "Oh, did that sting? Good! I want you to remember it."
* **Gaining the Upper Hand.** "I’m almost starting to feel bad for you—almost."
* **Bloodied.** "You think this is over? I’m just getting warmed up!"
* **Last Stand.** "Did you really think I’d fight fair? You have no idea who you’re dealing with!"
* **On Death.** "You think this ends with me? You’re in deeper than you know… You’ve just made enemies in very high places…"
