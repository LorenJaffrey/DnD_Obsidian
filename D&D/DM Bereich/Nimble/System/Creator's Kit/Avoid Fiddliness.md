*Fiddliness: clunky, overly complex, or tedious mechanical overhead that slows down play and distracts from the core fun.*

### Can I do this in fewer steps?
A single in-game action should typically take only one single real-world action to resolve. Fight the urge to add steps (saves, extra dice, etc.) wherever possible! Ask if the effect can simply *happen* automatically, or when something *else* does.

How long an action takes to resolve isn't about being in a hurry, it's about concentrating on the fun. Fiddly mechanics dilute the fun, spreading the same amount of fun out over a longer period of time. Take, for example, monster armor. Initially in development it reduced damage by a flat amount. Mathematically this worked, but mechanically it added an additional step to resolve. It didn't take very long, but multiplied over the dozens of attacks in an encounter, or **thousands** of attacks in a campaign, it was a suboptimal solution since it took up a significant amount of time.

Asking the question, "Can I do this in fewer steps?" is how Nimble landed on how monster armor currently works. Same end result, but with fewer mechanics getting in the way. This means more time for additional combat, story, roleplaying, and goofing off!

Find a way to eliminate as many steps as possible. Think this way with all of your design: Recognize how many steps are needed to resolve an action and eliminate as many as possible. Think of how it will be physically be resolved at the table.
### Can I make the calculation easier?
Math is inextricably tied to TTRPGs, it's part of the fun! But we should avoid anything but the simplest, quickest, calculations that can be done in one's head. Even very simple calculations, when there are a lot of them can grind play down to a halt and kill momentum. So we should avoid rolling and summing too many dice at a time. Summing at most 3–4 smaller dice or 2-3 larger dice is a good rule of thumb. More than that, and players will often have to hunt for extra dice, roll them (increasing the odds that one lands cocked, rolls off the table, etc. eating up more time), and adding them all up takes longer as well.

Rolling LOTS of dice is fun—*sometimes*. It can quickly turn into a chore and add slog to the game when required too often. Lots of dice eliminates variability as well, the more dice that are rolled the more likely you'll end up with an average result. A fistful of dice should be special and rare.

Where possible think of creative solutions to more quickly generate high numbers. In the core rules we use LVL, d20s, d100s, dXX, or flat damage (e.g. Condemn deals a flat 30 damage, this could have been 12d4, or 9d6. That would have dealt the same amount of damage, but would have taken much, *much* longer to accomplish).

> [!tip]- Exceptions
> Iconic or very large spells (e.g., tier 8 or 9 spells) or abilities that happen rarely (1/Safe Rest) can bend or break this rule of thumb. Cantrips or abilities that could happen multiple times in an encounter or even multiple times each turn should be **especially** quick to resolve.

* Build mechanics where players can immediately ***see*** the result rather than ***find*** the result (adding dice). Rolling 1d12 with advantage is easier than rolling and adding 2d8. Both have a similar average result—one requires no math, the other does.
* Avoid dividing by anything other than 1/2 (and even that shouldn't happen too often).
* Avoid multiplying difficult numbers (×2 is easy, ×13 is not).
* Avoid adding multi-digit numbers (2+2 is easy, 7+16 is a bit harder). Again, it isn't that players can't perform these operations, it's that they take *longer than necessary* and add small bits of friction to the game. Those bits add up, stealing valuable brain space, killing momentum, and creating SLOG.
* Design around easy increments such as 2, 5, and 10 as flat modifiers where possible.
* Avoid adding multiple large dice. For instance rolling 4d6 and summing a result of 3, 4, 1, 5 is easy. Rolling 4d12 and a result of 7, 5, 9, 11 is a bit harder. Rolling 4d20 and a result of 7, 16, 19, & 14 is more challenging still.

Much easier would be something like 2d6+5, 1d12+20, and 1d20+30 respectively. They have a similar average result but resolve much more quickly.

For instance, looks at how the Cheat's Sneak Attack began in development (as much as 10d6 at high levels), to where it ended up in the final version (1d20+20). Much better!
### Conditions
**Tracking Game States.** Be very careful with conditions and other game states that need to be tracked. Mechanics like this are really great for video games where the computer can handle the fiddliness, but for a manually resolved TTRPG it can become a big headache. These frequently result in interrupting the Flow as players remind others about the ongoing state, adding friction and slowing play down.

With this in mind, damage over time should be avoided completely. All damage should be resolved as the attack resolves. Conditions that have a visual component like Prone are easier to remember since you can physically knock the miniature over to represent it. Other conditions that cannot be represented visually should be minimized.

Monsters (or heroes) that can apply 1 condition, or temporary conditions that last only a single round, are fine. When there are multiple different conditions to track simultaneously the fun doesn't increase—with more to track, generally the fun ***decreases***. If something MUST be tracked, make it as easy as possible. For instance see the Hexbinder class, all of their afflictions apply only to a *single* monster, and other players need not remember any of them!
