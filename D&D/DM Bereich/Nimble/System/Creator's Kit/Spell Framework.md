**Average Spell Damage**

| TIER        | DAMAGE     |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| **Cantrip** | 6 damage   |
| **Tier 1**  | 14 damage  |
| **Tier 2**  | 23 damage  |
| **Tier 3**  | 33 damage  |
| **Tier 4**  | 44 damage  |
| **Tier 5**  | 56 damage  |
| **Tier 6**  | 69 damage  |
| **Tier 7**  | 83 damage  |
| **Tier 8**  | 98 damage  |
| **Tier 9**  | 114 damage |

**Spell Range**
The typical spell Range is 8. This is because it is just beyond how far a creature can move in a single turn (6 spaces). Spells with less Range should have some benefit, spells with a longer Range should have some drawback.

**Actions**
Cantrips cost 1 action. Tiered spells typically cost 2 actions. Reaction, or non-damaging spells can be reduced to 1 action instead. Ranged AoE spells, should cost 3 actions.

**Spell Schools**
Each spell school should have its own flavor and mechanics. Radiant spells, for instance, have Reach (not Range), aid allies and punish evildoers. Wind spells use the d4, are Vicious, and interact a lot with movement. Ice spells are very defensive and controlling, etc.

**Spell damage scaling**
The average damage of a spell per tier is listed below. If a spell does more than the average it should have a drawback (limited Range, status requirement, etc.), if it does less than this it should have some other utility or benefit (ignores armor, doesn't miss, etc.).

> [!tip]- Note
> These numbers assume no additional benefit or drawbacks, spells can and should deviate from the average once other benefits or drawbacks are considered.

**Remember!**
Damage is often NOT the most important aspect of a spell or ability. No single spell should be so good that it is the “go-to” spell in every situation. A spell's secondary effects are frequently the most important, fun, and memorable aspects as they allow for more creativity. Having a toolbox of different spells that are each best in their own situation is far more interesting than hyper-consistent (boring) spells that always hit exactly on the average damage curve, have no restrictions, or other benefits, drawbacks, or weirdnesses.

**Add wrinkles**
Spells that only deal damage in a straightforward way are boring.

**Avoid legalese**
Spells, more than other abilities can fall prey to Legalese: the language that lawyers speak in when writing contracts. Legalese is long-winded and not fun to read. Long-winded specificity can also kill creativity. Even worse than its length, however, is how this kind of legalese can set up an adversarial expectations between the heroes and the GM. The game shouldn't expect players to word things "as precisely as possible" nor should it expect the GM try and foil the hero's request.

Some examples are provided to help seed some possible ways this spell could be used, but beyond that, room is left for creativity. Since this is a collaborative game (and not adversarial contract law) with a GM who can fairly adjudicate anything that is unclear, we don't need that much detail. The players and the GM all want the most fun possible, we should leave the specifics to them.
