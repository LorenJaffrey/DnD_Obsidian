Unlike in other TTRPG systems, magical items (e.g., weapons) are not needed for classes to output the expected amount of damage across the level curve. Magical items instead should be thought of as a way to add interest to the story by giving the heroes more options to make choices that matter.

Magical items should always inspire choices, deepen the story, or enhance the fun, **never** just inflate power. Magical items could:

* **Shore up a weakness.** These items are best given to allow heroes to make the choices that are most fun for them. For instance a group of friends who all want to play the same class—it's not the most tactically wise decision, but it's what they find to be fun. These items make that more possible, or at least less punishing. Some party compositions may need help healing, or doing other magical things that a more balanced party could already naturally do: give flight to a party without access to wind spells, disguises, or the ability to speak a language they otherwise couldn't, etc.
* **Improve a strength.** The cheat's magical dagger could grant a shadow-step ability to teleport short distances, or a mage's staff could enhance their favorite spell (both ideally, at a cost).
* **Cause a wrinkle.** A cloak that grants invisibility might whisper temptations to the wearer, or a sword could enrage its wielder, risking collateral damage.
* **Hook into the story.** An item that starts a new quest: A mysterious locket might spark a quest to uncover its origins, or a cursed ring could require a ritual to remove it.
* **Decoration.** A Dwarven axe carved with runes and silver inlay, or Scholar’s Robes that shimmer with arcane threads.
* **Prestige (Titles).** Grant titles or symbols of renown, like “Knight of the Crimson Order” or a medallion of a secret society. Earned through heroic deeds, these carry social weight, opening doors to elite circles or swaying NPCs.
* **Get out of jail free.** Items that bypass obstacles or grant favor, such as a duke’s signet ring, the secret handshake of a thieves’ guild, or a tattoo respected by the city guard.
* **Push your luck.** A weapon that can deal extra damage or give you an ability, but can backfire (if used too frequently, on a miss, if something else happens).
* **Add silliness.** Include lighthearted items for fun and flavor, like a ring that instantly grows a magnificent beard or boots that leave glowing footprints.
* **Temporary/Consumable.** A legendary artifact that must later be given back, spell scrolls, wands, potions. Consumables in particular make for great items but Some heroes are very hesitant to actually use them. If they are available enough and affordable enough this can be greatly ameliorated. But the adventure can add some expiration date (an healing ice crystal that's melting), or some other catch (it only works in *this* dungeon) to encourage use and discourage hoarding.
* **Grant unique power.** Provide abilities that feel special but aren’t flat power boosts. These can unlock new hero builds, or inspire creativity or teamwork not otherwise possible. A sword that uses INT instead of STR, armor that ignores proficiency requirements, or a staff that can cast a spell with a chance of failure. It should be some ability that is either limited, comes at a cost, has a chance of not working, etc. So that it is a choice, rather than brainless and automatic.
### Find It or Buy It?
You should have loot heroes can both purchase and find. When would you give either?

* **Buy.** Flat bonus items (e.g., armor upgrades, a bigger sword) can give heroes a sense of progression. They're a good reward for heroes who save up their gold and can upgrade a piece of equipment. A lot of the fun for these is not so much having them, as much as looking forward to buying them. So they are most rewarding when saved up for and BOUGHT, not found. Even moreso if the vendor can customize it for them!
* **Find (or Given).** Other magical equipment is most rewarding when FOUND or rewarded, not bought. Prestige rewards are likewise best when given as a reward for heroism. A purchased title is worthless, a title bestowed due to bravery is priceless and can be game-changing.
* **Consumables.** Are great whether bought or found. They can permit a party to adventure away from home for much longer, and have built in limitations and choices—they go away when used.
### "Strictly Better" Is Strictly Worse
No item should be strictly better than all others in all situations. A Dagger is sometimes better than a Shortsword (e.g., when you value crits above missing), and vice-versa. Even for equipment that is clearly better, like the Tower Shield is better than a Wooden Buckler. One costs far more than the other, and has a strength requirement to compensate.

If you design a new shield, it should have some benefits AND drawbacks the existing shields don't have. Take for instance the Tower Shield (Req. 3 STR, +6 Armor), how could we modify this base item?

* **Ethereal Tower Shield.** We could reduce the STR requirement, but only if we also make it cost more, block for less, or have some other reason it is not strictly better than the regular Tower Shield.
* **Junky Tower Shield.** We could make this one block for the same amount, but instead cost much less, or maybe it breaks when crit?
* **Flying Tower Shield.** While worn, perhaps this tower shield allows the hero to fly, but it requires mana, or saps HP, or causes wounds, or they can't Defend or interpose while flying.
### Why It Matters
Items can be better in certain situations—but never strictly better. Otherwise we rob the heroes of meaningful choices, both when selecting gear and during combat. Do they prioritize durability, cost, or a unique ability? These choices enhance player agency and keep the game interesting.

By designing items with clear trade-offs, we can allow for meaningful decisions rather than automatic ones.
