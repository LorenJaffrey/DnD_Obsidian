Certain abilities, weapons, and spells have a specified Range or Reach, which determines how far away your target can be affected. If none is specified, default to Reach 1.
* In Melee. If any enemy is adjacent to you, your Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage (Reach attacks are not so affected).
* Long Range. You can gain disadvantage 1 to gain +2 Range on any Ranged attack (max +6).
