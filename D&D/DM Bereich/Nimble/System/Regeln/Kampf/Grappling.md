You can attempt to grab another creature provided you are within Reach and have at least 1 arm free (or some other way to grab them). On a failed STR or DEX save (DC 10+STR or DEX), a target:
* your size or smaller, is Grappled.
* larger than you, you gain the Riding condition.

Forced movement (pushing a grappler away), incapacitation, or spending an action and succeeding on a STR or DEX save can end it.

**Restrained**
Functions like Grappled, but is caused by objects (e.g., chains, rope, roots) and ignores size
restrictions. It can also be ended through any logical means, such as picking a lock or cutting/burning rope.
