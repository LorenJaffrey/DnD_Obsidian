The time you aren’t out adventuring is called **Downtime**. You can spend Downtime to recuperate from your adventures and partake in Downtime Activities. Not every moment of Downtime needs to be narrated or roleplayed. Much Downtime can be skipped over to get back to adventuring if desired. **Example Downtime Activities:**
* **Retrain.** Spend time doing activities to retrain any of your chosen abilities, features, or if it makes sense in the story, possibly even your subclass.
* **Gather Information.** Meet NPCs, pick up news, or collect rumors and job leads.
* **Personal Goals.** Pursue goals from your backstory or other smaller quests you’ve chosen.
* **Buy & Sell.** Get new equipment, and sell treasures you’ve collected while out adventuring.
* **Perform.** Play music, tell stories, compete, or perform in public to earn gold or fame.
* **Craft.** Create weapons, armor, or simple items using materials you’ve acquired.
* **Socialize.** Build alliances, make new friends, or make new enemies.
* **Invest.** Use your gold to invest in businesses or trade ventures for future profit.
* **Mentor.** Teach a skill or ability to another character or NPC.
* **Research.** Investigate a mystery, study ancient texts, or uncover hidden knowledge.
* **Serve.** Aid a patron or a deity in exchange for a favor, or perform charity for townsfolk.
* **Build.** Establish a home base, start a business, craft siege weapons, or build anything else you can imagine (GM and setting-permitting, of course).
