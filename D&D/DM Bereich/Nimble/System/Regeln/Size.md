Some spells and abilities affect differently sized objects or creatures. For size, use the following guidelines:

* Tiny can be carried in a typical pocket (many can comfortably fit in 1 space).
* Small can be carried in a backpack (2 can comfortably fit in 1 space).
* Medium is the average human size (1 can comfortably fit in 1 space).
* Large is roughly the size of a bear (1 can comfortably fit in a 2x2 area).
* Huge is roughly the size of a small house (1 can comfortably fit in a 3x3 area).
* Gargantuan can be as large as a castle keep (1 can fill a 4x4 area or greater).
