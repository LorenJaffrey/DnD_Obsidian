### Equipment Proficiency
Heroes can use any equipment they like; however, each class has a list of weapons and armor types they are most skilled with. Weapons used without proficiency cannot crit. Defending while wearing armor worn without proficiency costs 1 additional action.
### Swapping Equipment
A hero can sheathe weapons or shields they are proficient with and equip a different one for free 1/round.
### Weapon Properties
* **2-handed.** Can be held in a single hand, but must be wielded in 2 hands to attack with it.
* **Load.** Some weapons require extra actions to load before each shot.
* **Reach.** How close an enemy must be to be affected by this attack. If unspecified, Reach 1.
* **Range.** Attacks can be made from afar. If any enemy is adjacent to you, your Ranged attacks are made with disadvantage. Add 1 die of disadvantage to gain +2 Range.
* **Thrown.** Treat a melee weapon as if it had Range. Once thrown, you no longer have it!
* **Vicious.** Roll 1 additional die whenever you roll crit damage.

> [!tip]- Remember!
> Only the Primary Die (the leftmost one) is used for determining whether an attack crits. Every time you roll crit damage, roll the additional Vicious die as well!
### Dual Wielding
Heroes may wield 2 Light weapons at the same time. While dual wielding, you may gain advantage on an attack with those weapons, 1/round.

You may dual wield 1-handed weapons without the Light property if your STR is 3 or greater, or 1 weapon without the Light property if your STR is 2. If completely unarmed, fists/feet can be considered dual wielded.

> [!faq]- Dual wielding different weapons?
> Roll dice for both weapons and choose either result instead (the 1/round limit still applies). Attacking with advantage? Add an extra die for one of the weapons.

### Unarmed Strikes
To attack with your bare hands or feet, roll 1d4; on hit: deal 1+STR damage.
### Improvised Weapons
Using an improvised weapon (e.g. a chair, a frying pan, a big rock), default to 1d4+STR or 1d6+STR. Your GM may allow you to use bigger dice or other properties if it makes sense. An improvised weapon may be likely to break if it lands a crit, though!
### Customizing Weapons
Can you reflavor a staff as a greatclub? Sure! A sai instead of a dagger? Of course! Could you pay a blacksmith to make your 1d12 Greatmaul deal 2d6 or 3d4 damage instead? Since the dice all add up to 12, it won’t break the game; ask your GM! Can a blacksmith make your Dagger deal that much damage? No, sorry!
