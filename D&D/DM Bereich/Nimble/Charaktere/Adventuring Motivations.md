The world is a dangerous place—people don’t usually just “go adventuring“ without a reason. Your motivation should make your character want to work with the rest of the group.

> [!tip]- Or Make Your Own!
> A great character background has connections with the world, its people, your fellow heroes, or even the bad guys. Work with your GM and fellow players to find a motivation that will cross paths with where the story goes. Every good hero has a desire. What’s yours?
### I owe a life debt to someone in my party
Chat with your party: Who else needs help with their backstory? What did they do to help you?
### I owe a LOT of money to some very dangerous people
What did you do with the money? Your GM probably has some GREAT ideas of bad guys you’re in deep with.
### I need to grow in power to defeat someone who has wronged me
Do you know who wronged you, or are they unknown? Is it an individual or a larger group? Chat with your GM; they’ll love to help fill in the blanks.
### I am searching for a way to bring a loved one (or someone I hate) back from the dead
Who even told you this was possible? What if they don’t remember you?
### I am trying to get back home
Where is home for you, do you even remember? What caused you to leave? Chat with your GM; they can give you some options of homelands.
### I am searching for the one who stole something valuable from me
Is it an object? A person? A memory? Was it really stolen or did you make a bad bargain?
### I was polymorphed into another kind of creature by a wizard
Hah! How would it feel for a cute halfling to become an ugly goblin? What did you do to anger the wizard?
### Duty calls. I am honor-bound to serve
Who calls you? Your king? Your family? An ancient alliance or grudge? Talk with your GM and other players for ideas and mutual connections.
### I was best friends with (and betrayed by) someone
Do you want to win them back? Get even? Warn others of their backstabbing? Talk with your GM about who this might be.
### I’m lost
Physically? Emotionally? Spiritually? Are you in the wrong country or even plane of existence?
### Wanderlust/Pilgrimage
What amazing thing do you want to see or experience? Have you spent too much time away from the road? Your GM probably has some fantastic locations in mind for you.
### My home town is in danger
Are you looking for a cure? Mercenaries? Personal strength?
### Curiosity! I want to learn the DEEP secrets
Which secrets? Magical, lore, politics, what really happened in history?
### To prove my worth
You were always underestimated—by your family, your village, your peers, or yourself. What will it take to show them you’re more than they thought? What kind of recognition do you seek?
### I’m following a prophecy
A mysterious figure or ancient text foretold that you would play a crucial role in the fate of the world. What do you know of the prophecy? Do you believe it?
