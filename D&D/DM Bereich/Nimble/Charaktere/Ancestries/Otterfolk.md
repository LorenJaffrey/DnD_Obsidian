(Small or Medium)

*Playful, friendly, and always up for some wellintended mischief, Otterfolk are at home both in water and on land. Although they can be fierce warriors, they typically prefer using their environment to their advantage.*

**At home in water**
You have a swim Speed as long as you are wearing armor no heavier than leather. When Field Resting in water, you regain additional HP equal to your level.
