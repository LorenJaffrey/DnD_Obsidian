(Small)

*Slow and deliberate, but usually one ‘step’ ahead. Sluglings are never in a hurry to be anywhere, but can be valuable allies on any journey – if you have the patience.*

**Snail's Pace**
Your base Speed is 1, and you have a climb Speed. Your first move action each turn is free. Your level is always 1 higher than the rest of the party (up to 20). Vulnerable to salt. +1 armor.
