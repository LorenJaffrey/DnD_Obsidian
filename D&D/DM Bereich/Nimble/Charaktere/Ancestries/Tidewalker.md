*The tides are in your blood, the currents in your veins. You move with the rhythm of the sea — fluid and unbound. Yet the land holds no such grace for you. Though you might walk among those of the shore, the sea always beckons.*

**Tidal Grace**
You have a swim Speed, and you can breathe underwater. Advantage on DEX saves in water, but disadvantage on dry land. You can talk to fish if your INT is not negative.
