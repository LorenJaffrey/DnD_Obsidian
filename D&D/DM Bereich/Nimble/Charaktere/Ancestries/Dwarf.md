(Medium)

*Dwarf, in the old language, means “stone.” You are resilient, solid, stout. Even when driven to exhaustion, you will not falter. Forgoing speed, you are gifted with physical vitality and a belly that can handle the finest (and worst) consumables this world has to offer.*

**Stout**
+2 max Hit Dice, +1 max Wounds, –1 Speed. You know Dwarvish if your INT is not negative.
