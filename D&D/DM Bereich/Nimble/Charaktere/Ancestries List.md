Your kin, lineage, heritage, or race—this is how your character was born and how others see you at first glance. You may be a dwarf raised in the mines under the mountain with countless other dwarves, or you may be an elf raised by goblins! It’s up to you to choose how your character began. Choose 1 ancestry and add its bonus to your character sheet.

> [!tip]- Flavor Is Free
> Want to play a Stout Halfling instead of an Elusive one? An Optimistic Human instead of Tenacious? As long as it makes sense and the GM is on board, go for it!
> 
> Want to be a leaping Frogfolk instead of a Bunbun? A Flameborn Kobold? A winged Fairy instead of a Birdfolk? A Badgerfolk instead of a Stoatling? As long as it makes sense and your GM is game, go for it!

>[!faq]- What About Half–Elves?
> Mix the ancestries however makes sense in your world. You can pick one ancestral bonus and use it instead of both, or use both half as effectively or half as often.
