—— STEEL MEETS SPELL ——

**Arcane Command**
Your focus on the arcane causes you to lose access to Weapon Mastery and Combat Tactics, but you now gain INT mana when you roll Initiative (this mana is lost if unspent when combat ends). Whenever you could choose a Combat Tactic or Weapon Mastery, instead choose another Commander’s Order or a tier 1 (or lower) spell from any spell school. Your Commander’s Orders are also empowered with magical power:

* **Face Me! (Glimmering Decree).** Reaction (after an ally within 12 spaces is crit): That enemy takes STR d8 radiant damage (ignoring armor), is pulled up to 4 spaces toward you, and is Taunted by you until you drop to 0 HP.
* **Move it! Move it! (Borne upon the Wind).** When you roll Initiative, you may give yourself and an ally advantage on the roll, +3 speed, and the ability to fly for 1 round. Then, you both can also move for free.
* **Hold the Line! (Crystalline Armor).** (1/encounter) Reaction (when an ally drops to 0 HP): Command them to continue the fight! Set their HP to 3× your LVL. Additionally, they gain that many temp HP. Enemies who reduce this temp HP in melee have their speed halved until the end of their next turn.
* **Reposition! (Flashstep).** Action/Reaction (on an ally’s turn): Command 1 ally to move up to their speed (or 2 allies up to half their speed) for free. You may exchange places with one of them.
* **I Can Do This ALL DAY! (Rising Phoenix).** (1/encounter) Reaction, (when you would drop to 0 HP): You may expend any number of Hit Dice, set your HP to the sum rolled instead, and deal that much fire damage to each enemy within 2 spaces of you. They gain the Smoldering condition.
* **Coordinated Strike! (Withering Strike).** Any attacks made this way deal additional Necrotic damage equal to the max value of your Combat Die. An enemy damaged this way is considered undead for 1 round.

When you roll Initiative you may cast Enchant Weapon for free (can be upcast as normal by spending additional mana).
