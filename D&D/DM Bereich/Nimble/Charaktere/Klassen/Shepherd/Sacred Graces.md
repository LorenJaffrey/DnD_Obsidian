**Assist Me, My Friend!**
Whenever you make your first melee attack each round, you may add your Lifebinding Spirit’s damage to the attack.

**Empowered Companion**
Whenever you spend mana to call forth your Lifebinding Spirit, you cast it as if you spent 1 additional mana (ignoring the typical spell tier restrictions). The maximum die size is now a d20.

**Guiding Spirit**
When your Lifebinding Spirit rolls a 6 or higher on its damage die, the target begins to glow with radiant light. The next attack against that target has advantage.

**Hasty Companion**
+4 Reach for your Lifebinding Spirit. It can also act for free when summoned.

**Illuminate Soul**
Action: A creature within 6 spaces begins to glow with radiant light. For 1 Round, attacks against them are made with your choice of advantage or disadvantage. You may do this WIL times per Safe Rest.

**Light Bearer**
Regain 1 use of Searing Light when you roll Initiative (this expires if unspent at the end of combat).

**Not Beyond MY Reach**
You may target creatures who have been dead less than 1 round for healing. For every 10 HP a dead creature is healed this way, you may have them recover 1 Wound instead (you must heal at least 1 Wound to revive them).

**Vengeful Spirit**
Action: Your Lifebinding Spirit sacrifices itself to transform into a swirling vortex of radiant light. At the end of your turn, it damages all enemies within 3 spaces of you, ignoring armor and cover. This lasts for a number of rounds equal to the healing charges left on the Lifebinding Spirit. This effect ends early if you summon your spirit again.
