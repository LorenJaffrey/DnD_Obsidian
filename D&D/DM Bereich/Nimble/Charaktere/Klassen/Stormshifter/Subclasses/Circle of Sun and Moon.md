### Level 3
**Cycle Eternal**
(1/encounter) Action: Expend a Beastshift charge to enter Cycle Eternal. While in Cycle Eternal, you may shift between your normal form and beastform once per turn as an action without using a Beastshift charge. If you end your turn without shifting forms, Cycle Eternal ends. While in Cycle Eternal:
* **Solar Phase (Normal Form).** Your spells deal +KEY damage.
* **Lunar Phase (Beastform).** Gain +KEY armor and +2 speed.

> **Stable Cycle.** The Phasebeast Chimeric Boon only activates when you enter or exit Cycle Eternal, rather than every time you shift form during Cycle Eternal.
### Level 7

When shifting between normal form and beastform, you may either deal KEY damage to all enemies within Reach 3, or grant KEY Temp HP to all allies within Reach 3.
### Level 11
**Convergence**
When you exit Cycle Eternal, all enemies within Reach 3 may be either pushed 3 spaces or pulled adjacent to you.
### Level 15
**Eclipse**
Action (after shifting 2+ times during Cycle Eternal): Enter Eclipse Phase for KEY turns, then exit Cycle Eternal. While in Eclipse Phase, you gain the benefits of both Solar and Lunar Phase, may cast spells while in beastform, and may trigger Convergence once per turn as an action.
