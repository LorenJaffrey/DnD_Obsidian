—— CAST ASIDE, BORN ANEW ——

**Hollow One**
Cut off from your patron, you can no longer cast Shadow Blast and you can no longer cast tiered spells using Pilfered Power. However, as a parting token, you have stolen a secret from your patron: The magical Bonescythe, a weapon of sinew and bone, infused with shadowy magic.

**Bonescythe**
Action: Summon a magical Bonescythe, a melee weapon: 2d12 slashing+DEX necrotic damage to each die (Reach: 2). It shatters after you hit with it (or when combat ends). Any Invocations affecting Shadow Blast affect your Bonescythe Instead.

**High Levels.** Every 5 levels, add 1 extra damage die (Level 5: 3d12, Level 10: 4d12, etc.).

### Level 3
**Shadow Exploit**
Sacrifice a shadow minion to cast a spell at the highest tier you have unlocked. Each subsequent spell you cast in this encounter costs 1 additional minion.

**Martyr Spawn**
Whenever you Defend, you can sacrifice a shadow minion to take no damage.
### Level 7
**Grim Harrow**
When you strike with your Bonescythe, you may divide the dice as you choose amongst any number of adjacent targets within Reach.

**Reap**
When your Bonescythe crits, or kills a creature, summon a shadow minion for free.
### Level 11
**My Blood, My Power**
You may take 1 Wound to cast a tiered spell you know at the highest tier you have unlocked. 

**Otherworldly Might**
Advantage on concentration checks if you have any shadow minions.
### Level 15
**I’m the Patron Now!**
Summon 2 shadow minions for free when you roll Initiative.
