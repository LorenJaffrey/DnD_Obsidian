**Airshift**
You cannot be Grappled while conscious. While moving, you may travel across all terrain as normal ground, ignoring all ill effects (e.g., walls/ceilings, water, treetops, lava, spikes, clouds).

**Blur**
(1/encounter) When you Defend, you may first move up to half your speed away, taking no damage if you are now out of range or have Full Cover.

**Bodily Discipline**
You may spend 1 action to end any non-Wound condition on yourself.

**Enduring Soul**
Each time you roll Initiative, gain Hit Dice equal to the actions you get on your first turn. These Hit Dice expire at the end of combat if unused.

**I Jump On His Back!**
While moving with your Windstep, if you move into the space of a creature your size or larger, you may jump onto its back. While on a creature this way, gain advantage on melee attacks against it, and any damage you avoid is dealt to it instead.

**Kinetic Barrage**
Whenever you miss an attack, gain a cumulative +STR bonus to all damage you do for the rest of this encounter (a disciplined martial artist does not miss on purpose).

**Mighty Soul**
You cannot be moved against your will. Whenever you would fail a saving throw, you may gain a Wound in order to add your STR to the result you rolled. You may repeat this any number of times.

**Quickstrike**
When you Interpose, you may first make an unarmed strike against the enemy for free.

**Use Momentum**
Whenever you avoid all of the damage of a melee attack (whether it misses or you Defend), you may swap places with the attacker and then choose another target that is now within the attack’s reach, and they are hit instead.

**Vital Rejuvenation**
When you receive healing for the first time on a turn, you may heal another target within 6 spaces HP equal to your STR.

**Windstrider**
If you move through the space of a willing creature while using Windstep, they can move with you and choose any space adjacent to your path of movement to end in.
