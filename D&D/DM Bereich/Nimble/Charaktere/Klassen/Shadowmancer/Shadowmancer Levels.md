# Levels
### Level 1
**Conduit of Shadow**
Your Patron grants you knowledge of:

**Shadow Blast**
(Necrotic cantrip) Action: (1/turn) Range: 8. Damage: 1d12+KEY. High Levels: +1d12 damage every 5 levels.

**Summon Shadows**
(Necrotic cantrip) High Levels: +1 Reach every 5 levels.
* Action: Summon a shadow minion within Reach 1 (you can summon a max of INT or LVL minions this way, whichever is lower).

> [!tip]- Shadow Minions
