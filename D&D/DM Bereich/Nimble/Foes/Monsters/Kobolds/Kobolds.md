# Sample Encounters *(per hero)*
For an easier encounter use the line 1 or 2 levels lower. More challenging, 1 or 2 levels higher.

* **Level 1:** 3 Kobold Flunkies/4 Minions
* **Level 2:** 6 Kobolds*/4 Sneaks/1 Clanger + 1 Trapper
* **Level 3:** 2 Clangers + 1 Trapper/3 Trappers/6 Sneaks*
* **Level 4:** 4 Trappers/2 Denwardens + 4 Sneaks*

> [!tip]- Remember!
> Even very weak monsters can be far more deadly than intended when they outnumber the heroes by more than 4 to 1, Between 1 and 4 monsters for each hero is ideal.
# Kobold Loot
Honey, LOTS of twine, sandwiches (stolen), shiny objects, dragon painting (poorly—yet lovingly—made), rotting meats, a variety of traps (small cages, spikes, snapping).
