# Goblin Loot
Live mouse (a snack for later), moldy bread, smooth stones, sharp sticks, teeth (forcibly removed), arrows (surprisingly well-made), lots of blades (jagged, but effective), dead captive (forgot to feed him), shiny junk (random shiny bits of metal, broken glass, and buttons), slug farm (a jar of slimy, wriggling slugs), "Potion" (suspiciously colored liquid in a dirty bottle), unidentifiable jerky. A filthy notebook tracking bizarre trades and bets, boots (too big).
