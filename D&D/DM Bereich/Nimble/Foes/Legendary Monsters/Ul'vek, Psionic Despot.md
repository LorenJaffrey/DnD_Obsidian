**HP:** 300 | **Armor:** None | **Saves:** INT++ WIL++ DEX+

> **Mind Shield.** Whenever Ul’ would fail a save or take more than 30 damage while he has a creature Dominated, he may avoid the attack instead, but all Dominated creatures come to their senses.

**ACTIONS:** After each hero's turn, choose one:
* **Dominate.** (If no creatures are Dominated) Choose half of the heroes to suffer 2d12 psychic damage (ignoring armor). DC 15 WIL save or Dominated as well.
* **Consume.** (Dominated creature) Contested DEX or STR check, on success: Grappled and 6d12. Cannot be Defended or Interposed against.
* **Control.** Teleport 8. (Reach 8) DC 15 WIL save, force an enemy to spend one Action to make a weapon attack or cast a cantrip. On save, they attack with disadvantage.

> **Dominated:** Rolls are made with disadvantage while Dominated. Ul’ spend your first action on each of your turns, moving, making a weapon attack, or casting a cantrip. Damage ends.

**BLOODIED:** At **150 HP** gain **Illusory Shift.** Reaction, when attacked (1 use): Swap places with a Dominated creature, making them the new target of the attack.
**LAST STAND:** Ul’ is dying! **110** more damage and he dies. Until then, Dominated no longer ends on taking damage. Every hero makes a WIL save or become Dominated.
