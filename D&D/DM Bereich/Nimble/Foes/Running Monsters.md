The GM controls the monsters during combat. Monsters do not use Heroic Actions/Reactions. They can move, use the actions listed on their stat block, and their turn ends. Monsters die when they reach 0 HP.
# Monster Armor
While most monsters are unarmored, some creatures are tougher to take down:
- **Medium Armor: Just the Dice.** Monsters with Medium Armor (M) ignore all damage modifiers from stats and other effects, taking damage from the sum of the dice only.
- **Heavy Armor: Half the Dice.** Monsters with Heavy Armor (H) ignore damage modifiers and take half the sum of the dice (rounding up).

> [!tip]- Tell Your Players!
> When a monster has armor, it shouldn’t be a secret. Regular goblins are unarmored. That goblin? He’s holding a shield; he has Medium Armor. A golem that’s completely made out of metal? Heavy Armor.

**Dealing With Armor?**
Heroes’ critical hits, some spells, and damage type vulnerabilities ignore monster armor altogether. This means certain weapons and spells are better or worse against armored foes! This is also a great opportunity to remind your players about the Assess action.
# Default Monster Stats
Unless otherwise noted, assume that monsters are **medium**-sized, **unarmored**, have **speed 6** (can replace an attack to move again, or replace either one of those to retry a save), attacks have **Reach 1**, and roll **1d20 for all saves** (though some monsters may have advantaged / disadvantaged saves or checks when appropriate).
