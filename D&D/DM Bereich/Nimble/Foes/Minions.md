Minions are low-threat monsters that are easy to kill individually but dangerous in numbers. They add dynamic movement and excitement to battles without bogging down gameplay. Minions have:
* **No HP to Track.** Any damage kills a minion.
* **Easy Attacks.** Each minion attacks with a single damage die, cannot crit, and misses on a roll of 1.
* **Simplified Defense.** When multiple minions attack a single target, their damage is combined and counts as a single attack, so heroes can Defend or Interpose against them all at once.

> [!tip]- Act Together!
> If your heroes are facing down a pack of goblin minions, rather than moving them one at a time, all minions attacking a particular hero should move and attack at the same time. For example, 5 minions move next to Grudge and attack him. Roll and add up 5d6 (ignoring any 1s). Fast and easy!
