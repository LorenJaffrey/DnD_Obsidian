Welcome to the Nimble vault.

This page will introduce you to the vault and help you get started.

---

**What is the purpose of this vault?**
This vault was created as a way to put Nimble rules text into an easily searchable and editable form, as it was a recurring request in the Nimble community.

---

**What content does it contain?**
All content that could be used for referencing or homebrewing content. This means all classes, monsters, items and spells from the core rules, including rules reference and Creator's Kit content.

As a bonus, there is an optional folder with homebrew content from the [Nim+ zines](https://santuric.itch.io/) (vol. 1-3). If you want to use these, they can be merged with the existing folders for easy integration.

It does *not* include sections like how to be a good player/GM, and all the adventure & worldbuilding content. These are best experienced in the original format. It also does not contain Patreon and other exclusive content. Feel free to add it to your own vault if you have access.

Based on Core Rules version 2.0.2 and Creator's Kit version 1.2.

**How to use?**
Use this vault however you see it. You might use it as a basis for a campaign or worldbuilding project, or move the folders to an existing vault. All content has been ported without any plugins, scripts, themes or advanced setup, meaning it should be possible to integrate seamlessly or modify for your own purposes.

Throughout, you will find a few interactive elements. Headers can be folded by clicking the arrow next to it. Certain elements, like tips or examples, are written as callout boxes, which can be expanded by click on it.

There is also a "GM Screen" page with quick links to most elements, for easy lookup while playing.

Note that long lists, like spells, ancestries, backgrounds etc., have had the individual elements split off into their own notes, and then embedded into the parent note.

Lastly, the vault is set to Reading View as default. You can switch to Editing View by pressing ctrl+e, clicking the menu to the top right of the page, or changing the default setting in Settings -> Editor -> Default view for new tabs.
