*Tier 3 Radiant Spell*

**Casting time:** 1 hour.

**Effect:** Bring a dead creature back to life, provided they’ve been dead no more than 10 days and have not been revived by this spell before. Attempting to revive a creature already brought back with this spell risks raising a mindless, zombified husk instead.
