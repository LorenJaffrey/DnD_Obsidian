# Key Equipment
### Healing Potions
Healing potions are deep, shimmering red elixirs with a refreshing, effervescent taste. These potions are crucial for quick recovery, though their availability is limited. Small towns may have only a few, while cities offer more (but they are not in unlimited supply). The wealthy often use healing potions as a display of affluence, incorporating them into elaborate mixed drinks at social events to showcase their status. Potions require one action to drink or to administer to an adjacent willing creature.
### Torches & Lanterns
Heroes cannot typically see in the dark. Fighting in the dark imposes the Blinded condition. Heroes can bring a lantern or torch to light their way in the dark as long as they have a hand free (or some other way) to hold it. A torch typically lasts for 1 dungeon (or 1 level of a very large one). A lamp with oil can typically last for 1 entire outing, until your next Safe Rest. Torches and lanterns cast light up to **6 spaces** away; beyond this is darkness.

> [!warning]- Be Warned
> Denizens of the dark may not appreciate the light and may attack the light bearers first. Certain spells (e.g., Fire, Lightning, and Radiant) may cause flashes of light as well and draw unwanted attention!
### Equipment Availability
Costs for mundane items typically range from a few silver pieces to a few gold pieces. If you can find an artisan, you can commission them to create something for you—basically anything you can think of that their level of technology could support. The more ornate, the higher the price. Commissioning the creation of a special item will typically start around 50 gp and only go up from there. Smaller towns will have fewer items and artisans than larger cities.
