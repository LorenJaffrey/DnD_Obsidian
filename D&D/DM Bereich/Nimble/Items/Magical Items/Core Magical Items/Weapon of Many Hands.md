*(Rarity varies)*

While equipped, this weapon grants the wearer additional arms. The wearer can use the extra arms to perform any task their normal hands can do (wield equipment, Grapple enemies, climb, etc.) but does not allow the wearer to perform actions any faster. These extra appendages may be horrifying to people in polite society. A weapon that grants 1 extra hand is likely to be uncommon; 4 extra hands, legendary.

> [!faq]- Extra Arms?!
> Yes, you can dual wield 2-handed weapons or wear more than 1 shield, or Grapple 2 different creatures while hitting them both at the same time! Or any number of creative things, provided you have the arms to perform the task.
