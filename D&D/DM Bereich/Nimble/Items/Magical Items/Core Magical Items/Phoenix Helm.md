*(Legendary)*

If you die while wearing this golden helm, your body explodes in flames and hot ash. You rise anew from the ashes...

On Death: You are reborn as a golden fiery phoenix. Enemies within 6 spaces take **LVL d10** fire damage on a failed **DC 10+KEY** DEX save (half on save). Gain the following stats and abilities:
* Gain a fly speed of 10, 10 Armor, and 10×LVL HP.
* Creatures that touch you take LVL fire damage.
* **Fiery Talons.** 1 Action, 1d10+LVL damage.

After 10 minutes, this form ends, the helm is no more and you return with 0 HP and all but 1 Wound.
