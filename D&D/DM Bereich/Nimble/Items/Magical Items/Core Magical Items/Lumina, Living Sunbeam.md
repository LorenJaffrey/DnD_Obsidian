A small, radiant orb of light, about the size of an apple, with a gentle, warm glow that pulses with life and a perpetually cheerful expression. She is a one-time use item that, when activated as an action, will deal LVL d6 radiant damage to all enemies within 6 spaces and heal allies in the area for the same amount. Until then, she hovers around her owner, spreading warmth and light, and offering encouragement.
