*(Rare)*

A small, unassuming button etched with a faintly glowing sigil. When sewn onto an outfit, as a reaction when you are attacked, you may pull the button off and throw it into the air. The button emits a sudden, dazzling flash of light and a high-pitched whistle. The attacker must make a WIL save or be distracted, causing the attack to miss you.

After use, the button becomes inert. It can be sewn back onto a garment during a Safe Rest by an experienced seamstress or tailor with silver thread, which reactivates its power.
