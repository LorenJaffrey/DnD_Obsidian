**“Creative" Accounting**
Steal up to INT actions from your next turn (Gain up to INT actions now. The next time you would gain actions, subtract the number stolen). You cannot use this 2 turns in a row.

**Exploit Weakness**
Action: Make a contested INT check against an enemy. If you win, you can use Vicious Opportunist against them, even if they are not Distracted. This lasts for 1 minute or until you use this ability against another target.

**Feinting Attack**
If you miss for the 2nd time in a single round, you may change the primary die roll to any result instead.

**How’d YOU get here?!**
2 actions: “Teleport” up to 4 spaces away, adjacent to a Distracted target, and make a melee attack against them. If you crit, you may "teleport" again.

**I’m Outta Here!**
When an ally within 4 spaces is crit, you may turn invisible until the end of your next turn and then move up to half your speed for free.

**Misdirection**
Gain INT armor. Whenever you Defend, you may halve the damage instead.

**Steal Tempo**
When you land a critical hit for the second time on a turn, your target loses 1 action and you gain 1 action.

**Sunder Armor (Medium)**
Action: When you crit an enemy with medium armor, sunder their armor. Until the start of your next turn, ALL melee attacks against that target ignore its armor.

**Sunder Armor (Heavy)**
Req. Sunder Armor (Medium). Your Sunder Armor ability now also applies to enemies wearing heavy armor.

**Trickshot**
When you throw a dagger, it returns back to your hand at the end of your turn. On a hit, it ricochets to another creature within 2 spaces, dealing half as much damage to them.
