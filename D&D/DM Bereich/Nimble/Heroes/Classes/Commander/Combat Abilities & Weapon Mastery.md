Reaction (after an ally is crit within 12 spaces): Taunt that enemy until you drop to 0 HP.

**Hold the Line!** (1/encounter) Reaction (when an ally drops to 0 HP): Command them to continue the fight! Set their HP to 3× your LVL.

**I Can Do This ALL DAY!**
(1/encounter) Reaction (when you would drop to 0 HP): You may expend any number of Hit Dice and set your HP to the sum rolled instead (do not add your STR).

**Move it! Move it!**
When you roll Initiative you may give yourself and an ally advantage on the roll and +3 speed for 1 round.

# Combat Tactics
*1/attack, you can expend a Combat Die to add one of the following effects to your attack.*

**Commanding Presence**
Action: Shout a command up to 2 words long at an enemy. On a failed WIL save (DC 10+STR), they must spend their entire next turn obeying it to the best of their ability, provided it is not obviously harmful to themselves. They then become immune to this effect for 1 day.

**Heavy Strike**
When you hit, push a Medium creature STR spaces and deal extra damage equal to a roll of your Combat Die. A Small creature is pushed twice as far; Large, pushed half as far (round down). 

**Inerrant Strike**
Reroll a missed attack, add 1 to the Primary Die, and deal extra damage equal to a roll of your Combat Die.

**Lunging Strike**
Gain +1 Reach on an attack and deal extra damage equal to 2× a roll of your Combat Die.

**Sweeping Strike**
2 actions: Select any contiguous area within your weapon’s Reach and damage ALL targets there. This attack does not miss on a 1.
