### Level 2

You unlock tier 1 Radiant and Necrotic spells and gain a mana pool to cast these spells. This mana pool’s maximum is always equal to (WIL×3)+LVL and recharges on a Safe Rest.

**Lifebinding Spirit**
(Radiant Spell, Tier 1)
* Action: Summon a spirit companion that follows you and is immune to harm. It lasts until you cast this spell again, take a Safe Rest, or it heals a number of times equal to the mana spent summoning it.
* Action: It attacks or heals a creature within Reach 4. It attacks for 1d6+WIL radiant damage (ignoring armor), or heals for the same amount.

**Upcasting:** Increment its die size by 1 (max d12), +1 healing use.

> [!tip]- Flavor is Free
> Your Lifebinding Spirit can take the form of any small/tiny friendly animal or similar creature (dog, lamb, rabbit, sparrow, etc.). Make sure you give your little buddy a name, too! Outside of combat, your companion is a spirit, so it can pass through walls and dangers harmlessly and briefly move away from you (but always prefers to be faithfully at your side). It cannot speak.

> [!faq]- Rushed Attacks and My Companion?
> You and your companion use the same action pool, but count as different creatures. So you can each attack once without Rushed Attacks every round. Teamwork!
