# Lyrical Weaponry
**Heroic Ballad**
+2 max Songweaver’s Inspiration charges. When used to reroll an ally’s attack, your Songweaver’s Inspiration also grants them +WIL damage on the attack.

**Inspiring Anthem**
(1/encounter) Action: Grant all friendly Dying creatures who can hear you 1 HP and 1 action.

**Not My Beautiful Faaace!**
(1/encounter) When you Defend, force the attacker to choose another target within range on a failed WIL save (if there is none, the attack fails). If they fail by 5 or more, they attack themselves as punishment for even thinking they could harm you! On save, they attack you with disadvantage.

**Rhapsody of the Normal**
When you roll 4 or more on your Vicious Mockery, you may spend a Songweaver’s Inspiration charge to temporarily suppress any special abilities they have until the end of their next turn. They can do only what an untrained average villager can do, attack once for 1d4 damage and move up to 6 spaces (no armor, spellcasting, flying, regeneration, other inherent or trained features).

**Song of Domination**
(1/encounter) 2 actions: Play a bewitching tune, and all enemies within 6 spaces who hear it must make a WIL save. If they fail, you move them up to 6 spaces in any direction, and they cannot move on their next turn.
# A “People” Person
**Stompy**
3 actions: Summon a huge hill giant for 1 round. As he enters the battlefield adjacent to you, use **Stompy’s Stomp:** Make a DC 10 Influence check. On a success, he moves 6 spaces in a direction you choose; on a failure, he moves towards YOU instead ("YOU NOT FRIEND!"). He deals everything in his path damage equal to LVL+Influence check. ANY creature within 6 spaces of Stompy can use this ability once instead of an attack.

**Mal, the Malevolent Imp**
Summon a tiny fiend for 1 night. He can find out dangerous information you have no right to know! Or “take care” of a problem with only the slightest chance of things going wrong. Make an Influence check to convince him to help you (advantage if you ask him to do something he would find mischievous or fun; with disadvantage if it is something he would find good or menial).

**Gran Gran (NOT a hag)**
When resting, you may summon her for 1 hour to soothe your wounds (and hassle you for not eating enough). She bakes and hands out pastries equal to your WIL+INT. Eating one recovers one mana, Hit Die, or Wound. Eat them while they’re warm! They expire in 10 minutes.

**Linos, the Everfriendly**
Summon a legendary flying (but friendly) creature to take you and your party wherever you need to go. He may request a very large amount of food as payment.

> [!tip]- Flavor is Free
> If you’d rather have a more traditional bard type—a keeper of ancient legends—instead of people you know, the characters above can be reflavored as famous legends from history that you can magically summon via song. Feel free to work with your GM to make it happen. As long as the mechanics stay roughly the same, have fun!

> [!tip]- Making Your Own People
> You can work with your GM to swap out Stompy, Gran Gran, Mal, and Linos for your own creations if you like. 1 in-combat person whose damage scales with your level (see other spells and abilities for appropriate amounts of damage or other effects), 1 out-of-combat support person, 1 who can help in narrative situations, and 1 who can give sporadic utility. Follow that broad pattern and you'll be fine!
> 
> If you find yourself never wanting to use one, make it slightly stronger; if you're using it too frequently, consider bringing the power level down slightly or adding some other drawback.
