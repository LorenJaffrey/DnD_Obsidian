(Large)

*Stout as stone and treacherous as a summer glacier. Jotunn hail from distant lands where they while away the winter dark with many competitions of prowess and cunning.*

**Challenger**
+1 Might or Finesse. You ignore cold weather, and breathe comfortably in extreme altitudes. Advantage on skill checks when you engage in duels of wit, speed, strength or drinking.
