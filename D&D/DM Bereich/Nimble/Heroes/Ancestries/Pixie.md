(Tiny)

*The smallest of the fair folk. Whimsical and unpredictable. Pixies are usually considered harmless, but can be surprisingly competent in combat – especially if mistaken for some kind of insect.*

**Tricksy**
-2 Speed. Advantage on Stealth. You have a fly Speed as long as you are wearing armor no heavier than leather. Resistant to magic. Vulnerable to metal.
