*Unpredictable and chaotic, Wyrdlings are the result of magic gone awry. Their bodies pulse with raw arcane energy, and their mere presence often disturbs the balance of magic around them.*

**Chaotic Surge**
Whenever you or a willing ally within Reach 6 casts a tiered spell, you may allow them to roll on the Chaos Table. 1/encounter.
