(Any)

*You were marked by a lich as their living phylactery and hidden away. Their cursed essence eats away at your body and sanity. While you live, the lich cannot die. Will you embrace this gift, or seek to rid yourself of it?*

**Living Phylactery**
You know Necrotic cantrips. While you are Dying, attacking and casting does not risk causing Wounds. You feel a vague pull in the direction of the lich when you sleep.
