(Any)

*A curse? Perhaps a blessing? Either way, you must find a way to live with your innate ferocity. When instinct takes hold, you shift to your other self – maybe even your true self.*

**The Curse**
At night you transform into a feral beast. While transformed you can speak with animals, become vulnerable to silver, and gain a Vicious bite attack that deals 1d6+DEX piercing damage.
