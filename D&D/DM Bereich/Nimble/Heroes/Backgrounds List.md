Backgrounds provide a glimpse into your character’s past—how they were raised, the skills they honed before becoming an adventurer, or even their defining personality traits. Feel free to adapt or reimagine these backgrounds to suit your character’s story. Choose 1 background:

> [!tip]- Make It Your Own!
> Remember, backgrounds are just a starting point—you’re free to adjust, reimagine, or completely rewrite them to suit your character’s story. If you want to know a Utility Spell but don’t like the Academy Dropout flavor, come up with a different reason why your character might know it. Maybe they learned it from a traveling bard or discovered it etched into an ancient relic.
> 
> Feel free to swap traits, change the flavor text, or blend backgrounds together. Haunted Past might become Blessed by Spirits if your character views their otherworldly voices as guardians rather than tormentors.
> 
> Work with your GM to ensure any changes align with your game’s setting and are balanced with other backgrounds. These are here to inspire creativity—what you build with them is entirely up to you!
